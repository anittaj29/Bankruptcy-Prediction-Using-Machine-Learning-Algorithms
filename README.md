# Bankruptcy-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Bankruptcy data from the Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999–2009
Goal: Developed a robust predictive model capable of accurately classifying whether a company is at risk of bankruptcy. 

Major Steps:
1️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics.
2️⃣ Data Preprocessing, addressing data imbalance using SMOTE technique for enhanced model performance.
3️⃣ Feature Selection to focus on the most influential indicators.
4️⃣ Dataset Splitting for effective model evaluation.

Data Modelling:
Implemented a variety of algorithms including:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest
